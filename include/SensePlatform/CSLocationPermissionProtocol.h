/**
 Protocol that any object requesting location permissions through the CSSensePlatform should implement.
 After the user grants or denies permissions, one of these functions will be called on your object.
 
 Below an example of how this could be implemented in a view object:
 
 @interface TourViewController : UIViewController <CSLocationPermissionProtocol>
 @end
 
 @implementation TourViewController
 
 - (IBAction)handlePermissionButtonClick:(id)sender {
    [CSSensePlatform requestLocationPermissionWithDelegate: self];
 }
 
 - (void) locationPermissionGranted {
    [self refreshView];
 }
 
 - (void) locationPermissionDenied {
    [self refreshView];
 }
 
 - (void)viewDidLoad {
    [super viewDidLoad];
    [self refreshView];
 }
 
 - (void) refreshView {
    CLAuthorizationStatus status = [CSSensePlatform locationPermissionState];
    switch (status) {
        case kCLAuthorizationStatusAuthorizedAlways:
            break;
        case kCLAuthorizationStatusDenied:
            break;
        case kCLAuthorizationStatusNotDetermined:
            break;
        default:
            break;
    }
 }
 
@end
 
 */
@protocol CSLocationPermissionProtocol <NSObject>

/**

- (void) locationPermissionGranted;

/**

- (void) locationPermissionDenied;
