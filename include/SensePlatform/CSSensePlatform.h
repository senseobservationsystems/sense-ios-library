 The reason we need a delegate object that implements predefined callback functions is that the permission request dialog is presented asynchronously to the user. That means that we would lose any callback context provided to this function. Using an object implementing a protocol, we can temporarily store a reference to the object and callback later when the user granted or denied the permissions.
 IMPORTANT: This function will do nothing on iOS < 8.
 IMPORTANT: If the user denies permission, the app will not run in the background until the user explicitly grants permission to the app in the iOS settings screen.
